<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
I am a final year undergraduate in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in generalizable, interpretable, scalable Machine Learning often involving Deep Learning. I care able developing practically impactful algorithms or frameworks, while at the same time understanding why it works and formalizing its limitations. I am particularly excited about mathematically formalizing knowledge/learning, particularly for Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models, and Self-supervised Learning.

I have done research in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) and [MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/). I completed my undergraduate thesis on GANs under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Prof. [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) on sequence generative models in collaboration with [Apple Inc.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)

Status
======
- I'm actively applying for P.h.D. programs. 
- I will be graduating from CMU for spring 2020 for research internship with [Apple Inc.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) until summer 2021.

News
======
- [2020] [Improving GAN Training with Probability Ratio Clipping and Sample Reweighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06900) accepted by *NeurIPS 2020*
- [2020] My thesis was awarded the *School of Computer Science Alumni Award for Undergraduate Excellence*
