I am a final year undergraduate in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am interested in generalizable, interpretable, and scalable Machine Learning often involving Deep Learning. I care about developing practically impactful algorithms or frameworks, while at the same time understanding why it works and formalizing its limitations. I am particularly excited about mathematically formalizing knowledge/learning, particularly for Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, Generative Models, and Self-supervised Learning. My long-term research goal is to formalize or understand the notion of abstraction in machine learning.


I have done research in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) under Dr. [Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/) and [MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/) under Dr. [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/). Recently, I completed my undergraduate thesis on GANs under the supervision of Dr. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Dr. [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). Currently, I'm working with Dr. [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) on sequence generative models in collaboration with [Apple Inc.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)

Status
======
- I am actively applying for P.h.D. programs. 
- I am graduating from CMU and will be joinning [Apple Inc.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) as a research intern until summer 2021.
