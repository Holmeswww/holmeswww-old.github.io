I am a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), currently advised by Dr. [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/) and Dr. [Yuanzhi Li](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/yuanzhil/). I also work closely with Dr. [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/).

I am interested in reinforcement learning informed by natural language. My long-term research goal is to enable RL agents to benefit from human written guides or manuals.


During my undergraduate at CMU, I have done research in [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) under Dr. [Howie Choset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./choset/) and [MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/) under Dr. [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/). Recently, I completed my undergraduate thesis on GANs under the supervision of Dr. [Zhiting Hu](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/) and Dr. [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). I also worked with Dr. [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) on sequence generative models in collaboration with [Apple Inc.](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)
